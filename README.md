# react-dnd-treeview-with-chakra-ui-sandbox
react-dnd-treeview is one of many headless UI drag and drop sortable tree view component. 
The Demo example, and most example I found are using MUI(Material-UI). but react-dnd-treeview does not depend on MUI only. 
As I am working on a project using Chakra UI, I built this sandbox of react-dnd-treeview using Chakra UI Library and components.

## Live Demo on sandbox
